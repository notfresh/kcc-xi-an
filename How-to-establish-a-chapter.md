> The process to establish a KCC Chapter

The following process will be followed to establish a KCC Chapter.

1. A volunteer will request to establish a KCC Chapter by sending a message to [dev@community.apache.org](mailto:dev@community.apache.org) with "[KCC] Request to establish KCC in <name-of-your-town-or-city>" in the subject line. Before sending the request, the volunteer will make sure the following points are addressed.

   1.  1.1 There will be a single KCC chapter per town/city, so before sending the request please check the [KCC Chapters](https://kaiyuanshe.feishu.cn/wiki/Gxq4wnbX5iyehdkC4ukcBv9AnRc) to see if there’s an existing chapter in your location.

   2.  1.2 It is mandatory to have at least **1 Kaiyuanshe** member plus **2 KCC Workgroup** members in the KCC Chapter team. So before sending the request to the KCC Chapter establish message, the volunteer should make sure their proposed KCC Chapter team should have at least 1 Kaiyuanshe member plus 2 KCC Workgroup members.

2. After receiving a message on [dev@community.apache.org](mailto:dev@community.apache.org), a ComDev PMC member will start a thread on the **private** list to discuss on ALC Chapter establish proposal.

3. Based on discussion and votes PMC will take the decision on the ALC Chapter establish, this decision will be shared on the original thread initiated by the volunteer. (If the for some reason, the ALC Chapter establish request is **rejected**, based on 'case to case' basic PMC may give the reason for rejection.)

4. As the PMC **approves** the request to establish the ALC Chapter, the PMC will take the following actions.

   1.  4.1 Create the following "**placeholder"** pages for the ALC Chapter in [Apache Local Community - ALC](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COMDEV/Apache+Local+Community+-+ALC) space.

   2.   4.1.1 Create a child page of [ALC Chapters](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COMDEV/ALC+Chapters) with the title as "ALC <name-of-alc>". e.g. [ALC Indore](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COMDEV/ALC+Indore) This page will contain details about ALC Chapters and its members.

   3.   4.1.2 Create two child pages under the recently created "ALC <name-of-alc>" page (i.e. in the page created at 4.1.2). These three pages are as follows:

   4. - ALC <name-of-alc> Events e.g. [ALC Indore Event](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COMDEV/ALC+Indore+Events)
        -    This page will contain the details of past and upcoming events ALC Chapter
      - ALC <name-of-alc> Reports e.g. [ALC Indore Reports](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COMDEV/ALC+Indore+Reports) This page will contain the ALC Chapter Reports.
      - ALC <name-of-alc> Team meeting [ALC Indore Team meeting](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COMDEV/ALC+Indore+Team+meeting) This page will contain the ALC Chapter Meeting Notes.

4.2 Add an entry of ALC Chapter in [Reports](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COMDEV/Reports).

4.3 Provide the edit rights to the ComDev wiki to ALC Chapter volunteer.

1. PMC member will share details of the above-created pages and will request ALC Chapter member to maintain them on the same mail thread (which was initiated by the volunteer for requesting to establish an ALC Chapter). The volunteer who initiated the request to be set up the ALC Chapter will become the **[Chapter Lead](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COMDEV/Roles+and+Responsibilities+in+managing+ALC+initiative#RolesandResponsibilitiesinmanagingALCinitiative-ALCChapterLead)** for that ALC Chapter. And will make that the respective ALC Chapter is following [ALC Code of Conduct](https://s.apache.org/alc-code-of-conduct) and [Guidelines to organise ALC Event](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COMDEV/Guidelines+to+organise+ALC+Event).
